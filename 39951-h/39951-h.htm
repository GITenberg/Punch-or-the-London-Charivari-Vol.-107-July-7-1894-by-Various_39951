<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch's</span> <i>Sanctum at "the Season of the Year." Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Roger de Coverley</span> <i>and</i> Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax</span>.</p>

<p>"You may not recognise me, Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>?" quoth the old Knight, with stately modesty.</p>

<p>"Not recognise Sir <span class="smcap">Roger de Coverley</span>?" rejoined Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, urbanely. "Why, even disguised as a
Saracen's Head&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;I should know those well-loved lineaments."</p>

<p>"I perceive, indeed," said the Knight, with scarcely-veiled complacency, "that you have perused my friend <span class="smcap">Atticus-Addison's</span>
all-too flattering account of me and my several adventures."</p>

<p>"I know my <i>Spectator</i> by heart," replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>. "Nor," added he, turning to the quaint, black-vestured, bob-wigged
figure at Sir <span class="smcap">Roger's</span> elbow, "are Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax's</span> Tours unfamiliar to my memory. Like yourself, I can say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
       <p>'You well know what my pen can do,</p>
       <p>And I employ my pencil too.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
       <p>I <i>ride</i>, and <i>write</i>, and <i>sketch</i>, and <i>print</i>,</p>
       <p>And thus create a real mint;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
       <p>I <i>prose</i> it here, I <i>verse</i> it there,</p>
       <p>And <i>picturesque</i> it everywhere.'"</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>"Marvellous man!" cried Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax</span>, lifting his eyebrows until they almost met the downward curve of his tilted wig.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Toby</span>," cried Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, "call for clean pipes, a roll of the best Virginia, a dish of coffee, wax candles, and the
Supplement (otherwise my Christmas Number). Tell them, <span class="smcap">Tobias</span>, to follow with a bowl of steaming punch&mdash;my own particular
<i>merum nectar</i>&mdash;and Sir <span class="smcap">Roger</span> shall see what I have forgotten of his story, his tastes, and the duties of Amphitryon!"</p>

<p>In two minutes the Illustrious Trio were "making the centuries meet" under the benignly blending influences of
Good Tobacco, Sound Tipple, and Cheery Talk.</p>

<p>"And how fares 'Our Village' (to quote Miss <span class="smcap">Mitford</span>) in these revolutionary days?" queried Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> smiled, and promptly quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>"'And liquor that was brew'd at home</p>
        <p>Among the rest was seen to foam.</p>
        <p>The Doctor drank, the Doctor ate,</p>
        <p>Well pleased to find so fair a treat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Then to his pipe he kindly took,</p>
        <p>And, with a condescending look,</p>
        <p>Call'd on his good Host to relate</p>
        <p>What was the Village's new state.'"</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>"Exactly so," cried the pursuer of the picturesque, profoundly flattered by Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch's</span> prodigious memory.</p>
<p>"Aye, prithee, Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>," said the old Knight, seriously, "tell us what means all this new-fangled nonsense of
Parish Meetings, Village Councils, Hodge pitchforked into power, and Squire and Parson out of it, and I know not what
revolutionary rubbish and impious absurdity?"</p>

<p>"It means, my dear Knight," replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> pleasantly, "that power and responsibility, otherwise the Village
Vote, are, like a new <span class="smcap">Iphigenia</span>, to rouse the rustic <span class="smcap">Cymon</span> into manhood and manners, till he of whom it was said that

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph!" groaned the Knight, "too well, too well!</p>

might do well enough in poetry, but may mean ruin in practice. My misguided and stubborn friend, Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew
Freeport</span>, should have lived to see this day, and acknowledge the prescience of the testy old Tory he was wont to deride."</p>

<p>"Tilly-vally, my dear Sir <span class="smcap">Roger</span>," returned the host, cheerily; "trouble not thine honest soul with such gruesome
forebodings. 'The old order changeth, yieldeth place to new.' But 'tis 'lest one good custom should corrupt the world.'
<span class="smcap">Cymon</span>, <i>with</i> a vote, will not capsize the Commonwealth, any more than the British workman hath done, despite the
prognostications of <span class="smcap">Bob Lowe</span> and other cocksure clever ones. I'll see that the 'Good Old Times' are not banished, save to
give place to Better New Ones! The New Village, Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax</span>, may not be quite as picturesque&mdash;in the old artistically
dilapidated, damp, dirty, disease-gendering sense&mdash;as the old one. As you yourself said&mdash;

No, nor are cleanliness, sanitation, education, fair wage, an independent spirit, and the capacity for self-government. These
things, dear Doctor, make the Man, not the Picture, and Man-making is&mdash;or should be&mdash;the aim of modern statesmanship."</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>," said Sir <span class="smcap">Roger de Coverley</span> earnestly, "my only wish is that Merry England, in going in for the
New Politics may not lose the old humanities and humours and heartinesses."</p>

<p>"As described, Sir <span class="smcap">Roger</span>, in your own words, of which your presence and the festive season, remind me:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'I have often thought that it happens very well that Christmas should fall out in the middle of winter. It is the most dead, uncomfortable
time of the year, when the poor people would suffer very much from their poverty and cold, if they had not good cheer, warm
fires, and Christmas gambols to support them. I love to rejoice their poor hearts at this season, and to see the whole village merry in my
great hall. I allow a double quantity of malt to my small beer, and set it a-running for twelve days to everyone that calls for it.'"</p>

<p class="right blockquot">
(<i>The Spectator</i>, No. 131, Tuesday, July 31, 1711.)<br />
</p>

<p>"Trust me, gentlemen," continued Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, "all that was really good&mdash;like this&mdash;in the Good Old Times you
know can be preserved in the Better New Times we hope for. There will be plenty of work for the Sir <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, the
Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntaxes</span>, for your humane Vicar, Doctor, and your Squire <span class="smcap">Hearty</span> and Squire <span class="smcap">Bounty</span>, in the New Village as in the old
one. We love the old country customs, but our country dance cannot for ever be to the same old tune&mdash;even the loved and
time-honoured one of '<i>Sir Roger de Coverley</i>'!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the good old Knight, gladly, "you are doubtless right&mdash;as you always are&mdash;and I shall return to the
Shades greatly solaced both by your good cheer and your good counsel!"</p>

<p>"Sorry to lose your company so soon!" cried the Fleet Street Amphitryon. "I perceive, Dr. <span class="smcap">Syntax</span>, that your old

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>About the reminiscences of <span class="smcap">George Augustus Sala</span> there lingers
a before-the-Flood flavour which abashes my Baronite. In <i>Things
I have Seen, and People I have Known</i>, two volumes, published by
<span class="smcap">Cassell</span>, there is nothing merely modern. The only thing G. A. S.
doesn't appear to have seen was the world in the state of chaos, and
almost solitary among the people he has not known was <span class="smcap">Methuselah</span>.
That is an imagesion due to the art of the writer, for, as a
matter of fact, his recollections commence in the year 1839, when he
was a boy at school in Paris, snubbed, fillipped, tweaked, punched,
and otherwise maltreated, by way of avenging Waterloo in his
person, and redressing the petty injuries inflicted upon <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> at
St. Helena by <span class="smcap">Sir Hudson Lowe</span>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Sala</span> has not only lived long,
but, like <span class="smcap">Ulysses</span>, has travelled much, and has had singular good
fortune in being around when things were stirring. Thus, for
example, in the year 1840, as he happened to be strolling down the
Rue de la Paix, he saw a carriage draw up at a jeweller's shop,
escorted by a troop of shining cuirassiers. In it were two handsomely-dressed
ladies, "in cottage bonnets, with side-ringlets." There was
also a Norman peasant-woman, and in her lap reposed a greatly glorified
baby. One of the ladies was the Duchesse <span class="smcap">D'Orleans</span>, Consort of
the Heir Apparent, and the bundle of pink flesh was the Comte de
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, who seemed at the time to have nothing to do but to grow up
to man's estate, and take his place among the kings of France.
Sixteen years later, in the Rue de Rivoli, <span class="smcap">Mr. Sala</span> saw another
carriage; more glittering cuirassiers; another little pink face;
again two little pudgy hands, and a surrounding wave of lace. Baby
number two was the Prince Imperial, and the scenes culled from
the flowery field of the great journalist's memory mark two memorable
epochs in French history. A mere list of the people <span class="smcap">Mr. Sala</span>
has known, and the things he has seen, form of themselves an enticing,
even an exhilarating chapter. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> and <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> he
knew, and worked with, and he throws some fresh light on their
characters. Soldiers, actors, statesmen, kings, murderers, and
<i>habitats</i> of debtors' prisons, have all come under his observation,
and live again in his pages. He is careful to make it clear that this
is not his autobiography. On that he is still engaged. This work,
presented as a sort of <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i>, effectually serves to whet the
appetite, and makes the world hope he will hurry up with the
remaining dishes in the rare feast. "So says my Baronite, and the
Court is with him."</p>

<p>In reply to a question, which is "<i>not</i> a conundrum," at least
so says an Inquirer, as to "why the Baron spells 'sherbet' with two
'r's' instead of only one," the Baron would remind his interlocutor
that, <i>firstly</i>, "genius is above all rules"; that, <i>secondly</i>, the Baron
would rather err with two "r's" than have anything to do with a
"bet" when it can possibly be avoided; <i>thirdly</i>, that being of a
generous disposition, in this hot weather he loves prodigality in
liquids; not ashamed of avowal. <i>Finally</i>, he states that he unconditionally
withdraws the "r" in the second syllable of "sherbert,"
because in "sher<i>bet</i>" there is no <i>'ert</i> to anyone. So here's to his
eminent Inquirer's jolly good health, says</p>

<h2>NOBLESSE OBLIGE.</h2>

<p>One of the most pleasing incidents at the opening of the Tower
Bridge was the introduction by the <span class="smcap">Lord Chamberlain</span> of the
Recorder of London to H.R.H. the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>. "Our Own
Special" was not sufficiently near to hear the dialogue that passed
between them, but he has reasons for believing that Lord <span class="smcap">Carrington</span>
observed to H.R.H., "Sir, I have the honour to present to your notice
Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Hall</span>." Not to be outdone in courtesy, the Recorder
immediately added, "And I, Sir, am delighted to make known to
your Royal Highness Lord <span class="smcap">Carrington</span>." Then returned the
Prince, with his customary gracious kindliness, "I am rejoiced
to meet two officials of so much distinction; but, do you know,&mdash;I
fancy we have met before! Indeed I am certain that the
excellent make-up of Sir <span class="smcap">Charles'</span> wig and the easy carriage of
the <span class="smcap">Lord Chamberlain</span> could only have been acquired by long practice
on the boards of the Cambridge A.D.C. I congratulate you my
Lord, and you Mr. Recorder upon the excellent use to which you have
put the educational advantages that you and I have derived from
our common <i>Alma Mater</i>." At this point the Tower guns began to
be fired, and consequently the remainder of the conversation was lost
in the reverberations of heavy artillery.</p>

<p class="center">PART I.&mdash;SHADOWS CAST BEFORE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Rupert Culverin's</span> <i>Study at Wyvern Court. It
is a rainy Saturday morning in February.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>is at his
writing-table, as</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>enters with a deprecatory air.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Lady Culverin.</i> So <i>here</i> you are, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>! Not <i>very</i> busy, are
you? I won't keep you a moment. (<i>She goes to a window.</i>) Such a
nuisance it's turning out so wet with all these people in the house,
isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Well, I was thinking that, as there's nothing doing
out of doors, I might get a chance to knock off some of these confounded
accounts, but&mdash;(<i>resignedly</i>)&mdash;if you think I ought to go and
look after&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> No, no, the men are playing billiards, and the women
are in the Morning Room&mdash;<i>they</i>'re all right. I only wanted to ask
you about to-night. You know the <span class="smcap">Lullingtons</span> and the dear
Bishop and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, and
one or two other people, are
coming to dinner? Well, who
ought to take in <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>in dismay</i>). <span class="smcap">Rohesia!</span>
No idea she was coming
down this week!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Yes, by the 4.45.
With dear <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. Surely you
knew that?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> In a sort of way;
didn't realise it was so near,
that's all.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> It's some time
since we had her last. And she
wanted to come. I didn't think
you would like me to write and
put her off.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Put her off? Of
course I shouldn't, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>.
If my only sister isn't welcome
at Wyvern at any time&mdash;I say,
at <i>any</i> time&mdash;where the deuce
<i>is</i> she welcome?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I don't know,
dear <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. But&mdash;but about
the table?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> So long as you don't
put her near me&mdash;that's all <i>I</i>
care about.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I mean&mdash;ought I
to send her in with Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>,
or the Bishop?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Why not let 'em
toss up? Loser gets her, of
course.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> <i><span class="smcap">Rupert!</span></i> As if
I could suggest such a thing to
the Bishop! I suppose she'd
better go in with Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>&mdash;he's
Lord Lieutenant&mdash;and
then it won't matter if
she <i>does</i> advocate Disestablishment.
Oh, but I forgot; she
thinks the House of Lords ought to be abolished <i>too</i>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Whoever takes <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> in is likely to have a time of it.
Talked poor <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> into his tomb a good ten years before he was
due there. Always lecturing, and domineering, and laying down
the law, as long as <i>I</i> can remember her. Can't stand <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>&mdash;never
could!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I don't think you ought to say so, really, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.
And I'm sure <i>I</i> get on very well with her&mdash;generally.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Because you knock under to her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I'm sure I don't, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>&mdash;at least, no more than
everybody else. Dear <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> is so strong-minded and advanced and
all that, she takes such an interest in all the new movements and
things, that she can't understand contradiction; she is so democratic
in her ideas, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Didn't prevent her marrying <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>. And a democratic
Countess&mdash;it's downright unnatural!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> She believes it's her duty to set an example and meet
the People half way. That reminds me&mdash;did I tell you Mr. <span class="smcap">Clarion
Blair</span> is coming down this evening, too?&mdash;only till Monday,
<span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair!</span> never heard of him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I suppose I forgot. <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span> isn't his <i>real</i>
name though; it's only a&mdash;an alias.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Don't see what any fellow wants with an alias. What <i>is</i>
his real name?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Well, I know it was <i>something</i> ending in "ell," but
I mislaid his letter. Still, <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span> is the name he writes
under; he's a poet, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, and quite celebrated, so I'm told.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>uneasily</i>). A poet! What on earth possessed you to ask
a literary fellow down <i>here</i>? Poetry isn't much in our way; and a
poet <i>will</i> be, confoundedly!</p>

    <a href="images/004.png"><img width="300" height="375" src="images/004t300.png" alt="Sir Rupert" /></a>
    <p class="captionc">"What on earth possessed you to ask a literary fellow down <i>here</i>?"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I really couldn't help it, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> insisted
on my having him to meet her. She likes meeting clever and interesting
people. And this Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>, it seems, has just written a
volume of verses which are finer than anything that's been done
since&mdash;well, for <i>ages</i>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> What sort of verses?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Well, they're charmingly bound. I've got the book
in the house, somewhere. <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> told me to send for it; but I
haven't had time to read it yet.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Shouldn't be surprised if <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> hadn't, either.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> At all events, she's heard it talked about. The young
man's verses have made quite a
sensation; they're so dreadfully
clever, and revolutionary, and
morbid and pessimistic, and all
that, so she made me promise to
ask him down here to meet her!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Devilish thoughtful
of her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Wasn't it? She
thought it might be a valuable
experience for him; he's sprung,
I believe, from <i>quite</i> the middle
class.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Don't see myself
why should he be sprung on <i>us</i>.
Why can't <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> ask him to
her own place?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I daresay she
will, if he turns out to be quite
presentable. And, of course, he
<i>may</i>, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, for anything we
can tell.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Then you've never
seen him yourself! How did
you manage to ask him here,
then?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Oh, I wrote to
him through his publishers.
<span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> says that's the usual
way with literary persons one
doesn't happen to have met.
And he wrote to say he would
come.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> So we're to have a
morbid revolutionary poet staying
in the house, are we?
He'll come down to dinner in a
flannel shirt and no tie&mdash;or else
a <i>red</i> one&mdash;if he don't bring
down a beastly bomb and try
to blow us all up! You'll find
you've made a mistake, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>,
depend upon it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Dear <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>,
aren't you just a little bit <i>narrow</i>? You forget that nowadays the
very best houses are proud to entertain Genius&mdash;no matter <i>what</i> their
opinions and appearance may be. And besides, we don't know what
changes may be coming. Surely it is wise and prudent to conciliate
the clever young men who might inflame the masses against us.
<span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> thinks so; she says it may be our only chance of stemming
the rising tide of Revolution, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Oh, if <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> thinks a revolution can be stemmed by
asking a few poets down from Saturday to Monday, she might do
<i>her</i> share of the stemming at all events.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> But you will be <i>nice</i> to him, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, won't you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> I don't know that I'm in the habit of being uncivil to
any guest of yours in this house, my dear, but I'll be hanged if I
<i>grovel</i> to him, you know; the tide ain't as high as all that. But it's
an infernal nuisance, 'pon my word it is; you must look after him
yourself, <i>I</i> can't. I don't know what to talk to geniuses about; I've
forgotten all the poetry I ever learnt. And if he comes out with any
of his Red Republican theories in <i>my</i> hearing, why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Oh, but he <i>won't</i>, dear. I'm certain he'll be quite
mild and inoffensive. Look at <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>&mdash;the bust, I mean&mdash;and
<i>he</i> began as a poacher!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Ah, and this chap would put down the Game Laws if he
could, I daresay; do away with everything that makes the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

worth living in. Why, if he had his way,
<span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, there wouldn't be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I know, dear, I know. And
you must make him see all that from <i>your</i>
point. Look, the weather really seems to be
clearing a little. We might all of us get out
for a drive or something after lunch. I
would ride, if <i>Deerfoot</i>'s all right again;
he's the only horse I ever feel <i>really</i> safe
upon, now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Sorry, my dear, but you'll have
to drive then. <span class="smcap">Adams</span> tells me the horse is
as lame as ever this morning, and he don't
know what to make of it. He suggested
having <span class="smcap">Horsfall</span> over, but I've no faith in
the local vets myself, so I wired to town for
old <span class="smcap">Spavin</span>. He's seen <i>Deerfoot</i> before, and
we could put him up for a night or two. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, <i>the butler, who enters with a
telegram.</i>) Eh, for me? just wait, will you,
in case there's an answer. (<i>As he opens it.</i>)
Ah, this <i>is</i> from <span class="smcap">Spavin</span>&mdash;h'm, nuisance!
"Regret unable to leave at present, bronchitis,
junior partner could attend immediately
if required.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spavin.</span>" Never knew
he <i>had</i> a partner.</p>

<p><i>Tredw.</i> I did hear, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, as Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spavin</span> was looking out for one quite recent,
being hasthmatical, m'lady, and so I suppose
this is him as the telegram alludes to.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Very likely. Well, he's sure to
be a competent man. We'd better have him,
eh, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Oh, yes, and he must stay till
<i>Deerfoot</i>'s better. I'll speak to <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>
about having a room ready in the East
Wing for him. Tell him to come by the
4.45, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. We shall be sending the
omnibus in to meet that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> All right, I've told him. (<i>Giving
the form to</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>.) See that that's
sent off at once, please. (<i>After</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>
<i>has left.</i>) By the way, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>
may kick up a row if she has to come up in
the omnibus with a vet, eh?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Goodness, so she might! but
he needn't go <i>inside</i>. Still, if it goes on
raining&mdash;I'll tell <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> to order a fly for
him at the station, and then there <i>can't</i> be
any bother about it.</p>

<p class="center">No. I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bouquet de Babylon; or, The
Citizen's Evening Walk.</span></p>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
<p>Pheugh! Doctors may talk, but&mdash;I've <i>been for a walk</i>, which they swear will keep down adiposity,</p>
<p>And preserve your liver from chill and shiver, or growing a shrivelled callosity.</p>
<p>So I put on my hat&mdash;for I <i>am</i> getting fat!&mdash; and I've <i>been</i> for a walk&mdash;in the City.</p>
<p>The result of that walk? Well my mouth is like chalk
and my eyes feel all smarting and gritty;</p>
<p>I've got a sore throat from the matter afloat
in the air. It may sound like a fable,</p>
<p>But I'm game for betting that London is getting
one large and malodorous <i>stable</i>!!</p>
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
<p>Dear days of <span class="smcap">McAdam</span>! If <i>only</i> we had 'em,
with all disadvantages, back again!
</p>
<p>Oh! to hear the rattle of well-shod cattle
upon the old granite-laid track again.
</p>
<p>But this wooden pavement, e'en after lavement
is simple enslavement to nastiness,
</p>
<p>For when it is dry 'tis foul dust in your eye,
and when moist mere malodorous pastiness.
</p>
<p>Oh, slip-sloppy Cabby, this <i>Bouquet de Babylon</i>
sniffs of ammonia horridly,
</p
><p>And stable-dust flying is terribly trying
when Ph&oelig;bus is pouring down torridly!</p>
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
<p>My palate quite hot is, my larynx and glottis
feel like an Augean Sahara,
</p>
<p>I'm frantic with drouth, and the taste in my mouth
is a mixed Malebolge and Marah.
</p>
<p>The water-carts come; but they're only a hum,
for the sun and the wind dry it up again,
</p>
<p>And then on manure in a powder impure
the pedestrian's fated to sup again.
</p>
<p>It's worse than a circus. If men from the "Vorkus"
were turned on to keep it well swept up,
</p>
<p>There <i>might</i> be improvement. But there's no such movement;
the dire thorax-torture is kept up.</p>
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
<p>Manure-desiccation sets up irritation
and then inflammation will follow,
</p>
<p>Your tonsils get red, you've a pain in your head,
and you find it a labour to swallow.
</p>
<p>And as to your nose!&mdash;well, I do not suppose
for that organ reformers feel pity,
</p>
<p>Or I really can't think every species of stink
would find such ready home in the City.
</p>
<p>There's nothing more foul than your grim Asphalte-ghoul,
&mdash;save that dread Tophet Valley of <span class="smcap">Bunyan's</span>!&mdash;
</p>
<p>And then manhole whiffs! Or nose-torturing sniffs
from the shops that sell "Sausage-and-onions"!!</p>
    <div class="stanza">
    </div>
<p>What everyone knows is the human proboscis
this <i>Bouquet de Babylon</i> bothers.
</p><p>Surely pavements of wood cannot be very good
when they lead to such stenches and smothers.
</p><p>Ah, Sir, and dear Madam, I'm sure old <span class="smcap">McAdam</span>
&mdash;though scientist prigs may prove sceptic&mdash;
</p><p>Would be welcomed back by the sore-throated pack.
Mother Earth is the true Antiseptic!!
</p><p>And so ends my talk on a late evening walk,
and the woes of this dashed wooden pavement,
</p><p>Which worries my nose, sets my thorax
in throes, my nostrils stuffs up, till I'm like
a pug pup, all snorts, sniffs, and snuffles;
my temper it ruffles; gives me a choked
lung, and a coppery tongue, a stomach at
war, and a nasal catarrh; a cough and a
sneeze, and a gurgle and wheeze; a thirst
quite immense, and a general sense that
the bore is intense; and a perfect conviction,
beyond contradiction, that till
the new brood paved our city with wood,
and its air made impure with dust-powdered
manure, I never was sure that at
last I had hit on one poor true-born Briton
who <i>was</i> for a sore-throated slave meant!</p>

<h2 class="sans">GAIETY "SANS-GÊNE."</h2>

<p><i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i>, represented by Madame <span class="smcap">Réjane</span>, at the
Gaiety Theatre, has made a decided hit. The plot of the piece by
Messieurs <span class="smcap">Sardou</span> and <span class="smcap">Moreau</span> is poor, but it shows what an experienced
dramatist can do with meagre materials and one strikingly
good notion. It seems as if the plan of the play was started from the
idea of an interview between the great <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, when Emperor,
with a washerwoman whose bill for washing and mending he, when
only a poor lieutenant, had been unable to discharge. This scene is
the scene <i>par excellence</i> of the piece. It is here that both Madame
<span class="smcap">Réjane</span> and <span class="smcap">M. Duquesne</span> are at their very best. Besides this,
and the scene between <i>Napoléon</i>, <i>La Reine Caroline</i>, and <i>Madame
de Bulow</i>, when there is a regular family row admirably acted by
<span class="smcap">M. Duquesne</span>, with the
tongs, and Mlles. <span class="smcap">Verneuil</span>
and <span class="smcap">Suger</span> with their glib
tongues, there is very little
in the piece.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
    <a href="images/009.png"><img width="150" height="340" src="images/009t150.png" alt="Madame Sans-Gêne" /></a>
    <p class="captionc">Madame Sans-Gêne "going Nap."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Candé</span>, as the sergeant
who rises to <i>Maréchal</i>,
is very good, as is
also <span class="smcap">M. Lerand</span>, as <i>Fouché</i>.
Madame <span class="smcap">Réjane</span> is a
thorough <i>comédienne</i>, but
it is most unlikely (good as
are historically the stories
told about this same washerwoman
elevated to the rank
of Duchess) that she, in an
interval of nineteen years&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
between 1792 and
1811&mdash;should not have been
able to wear her costume
with, at all events, some
grace and dignity, and it
is most improbable that
the clever <i>blanchisseuse</i> of
1792 should, in 1811, have
found any difficulty in
managing her Court costume
without rendering
herself outrageously
ridiculous. All this hitching
up of the dress and
kicking out of the leg
"goes" immensely with
the audience; and this
must be the <i>comédienne's</i>
excuse for overdoing the
farcical business of her
chief scenes, save the best
of all, which, as I have
already surmised, was the
motive of the piece, namely,
the scene with the
Emperor in the Third Act.
Here she is perfect, only
just assuming so much of
her old manner as would
naturally come to her when chatting with "the little Corporal" over
old times.</p>

<p>As to <span class="smcap">M. Duquesne</span> as <i>Napoléon premier</i>,&mdash;well, middle-aged play-goers
will call to mind Mr. <span class="smcap">Benjamin Webster</span> as a far more perfect
portrait of the great Emperor than is <span class="smcap">M. Duquesne</span>, but the latter
has the advantage in manner, and realises the Emperor's traditional
eccentric habits in a way which at once appeals to all conversant with
the story of the eccentricities of the Great Emperor when he chanced
to be in a very good humour. Perhaps nowadays there are very few
who read <span class="smcap">Lever's</span> works, but a dip into <i>Charles O'Malley</i>, with
<span class="smcap">Phiz's</span> spirited imagestrations, will give exactly the phase of <span class="smcap">Napoleon's</span>
character that Messrs. <span class="smcap">Sardou</span> and <span class="smcap">Moreau</span> have depicted
in this piece.</p>

<p>The play is well mounted, and the acting of all, from the leading
parts to the very least, is about as good as it can be. The incidents
of the drama are not particularly novel, but they are safe, and to
every Act there is a good dramatic finish. Madame <span class="smcap">Réjane</span> may
congratulate herself and "Co." on a decided success in London.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> was driving lately in a friend's barouche, which seemed
to swing about a great deal, and made her feel rather uncomfortable.
She was not surprised at this, however, when she heard the carriage
was on "Sea" springs!</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON THE WONDERFUL BRIDGE AGAIN.</h2>

<p>I reely begins for to think as how as a truly onest Waiter, as knos
his place, and his warious dooties, and is allers sivil and hobligin,
gits more respected and more thort on the holder he gros. Here have
I bin atending at the werry best houses both at the West Hend, and
also at the pride of all Hed Waiters, the onered Manshun Ouse, for
nearly twenty long ears, and I can trewly say as I allers gets a sivil
word from everyboddy. And when sumboddy was speshally wanted
the other day to sho that most himportent Body, the London Press,
all over the Wunderfool Tower Bridge, so that they coud give a trew
and correct acount of all its wunders for the newspaper peeple to read
and wunder at, who did the clever Chairman select to help in that
most himportent hoffice but me, tho I am only <span class="smcap">Robert</span> the Citty
Waiter! And when the thowsends and tens of thowsends of peeple
red the gloing acounts as filled the Press a day or too arterwards, they
little thort perhaps of the many risks as the pore Waiter ran to save
hisself and the reporters from the fallin Grannit, and the blocks of
mettel, as every now and then fell about us!</p>

<p>One of the werry biggest and blackest of the hole lot fell within
about six foot of where I stood, so jest another six foot mite have
put a hend to a Waiter who, I fondly hopes, has done his duty like a
man and a Brother, tho many peeple did sumtimes larf at him.</p>

<p>Strange to say, only jest 2 days before my honered wisit to the
wunderfool Bridge, I was arsked to take a jurney to Boolong, which I
bleeves is in France, and back again in the same day! but I aint a
werry good Sailer so I thort I had better decline it. So <span class="smcap">Brown</span> went
in my place, and werry much he says he injoyed it, tho he didn't git
home till eleven o Clock at night!</p>

<p>I don't think as he's a werry good sailer, so, if he did enjoy it,
the sea must have bin werry uncommon smooth, and both ways,
too! He says it ways a butiful new wessell, and called the <i>Margerreet</i>,
which, strange to say, was his Grandmother's name, which may
acount for its treeting him so smoothly.</p>

<p>Most of the Gents of the London Press on their wisit to the Big
Bridge seemed to think most of the opening and shuttin of the
enormers shutters as they opened and shut all of their own acord
to let the big ships go thro, and werry wunderfool they suttenly
was, but to my poor mind, ewery body as reelly wants to see the
most butiful part of the hole show shoud have hisself took up in the
lift to the walk along the top, which is only about 240 feet high, and
then he can have such a grand view of our butiful river Tems as
werry few has ewer had since it was fust made. One of the Press
Gents, seeing me staring at it with wunder and admiration, came up
to me and sed, "Why, Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, you've most suttenly picked
out the most lovely view of the lot. I don't know what enormus
distance we can see, but if you looks just where I'm a pinting you
will see the Kristel Pallis, and it don't look more than a mile or two
away!" No more it did! And as for the crowds of ships as we
coud see with our naked eyes, I schod have thort they was more than
ewer entered the River in a month or two, and all round was the
butiful hills and grand houses, and everythink looking chock full of
bussel and prosperity, and all quite reddy to make use of the butiful
Bridge as soon as ever it was opened! as it was by the nobel Prince
of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> on the following Satterday.</p><p class="right"> <span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 25.</i>&mdash;Asquith
back on Treasury Bench quite a
changed man. Anxious air that marked his
appearance through last week disappeared.
Painful to watch him as he then sat on Bench
with one eye on the door. Started at rustle of
paper of amendments. Half rose from his
seat if a book fell.</p>

<p>"Yes <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said, when I congratulated
him on the happy accomplishment of
the event; "it's not the kind of thing I should
like to go through every six months. Till
he's tried it, no one knows what it is to have a
steam engine stationed at his front door night
and day with steam up ready to whisk him
off to White Lodge at a moment's notice."
<span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> managed to keep much
cooler than the Mayor of <span class="smcap">Richmond</span>. This
morning the papers ablaze with telegrams from
that functionary. <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> is his name,
Surrey is his county. As soon as notification
made of birth of prince, <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> took off his
coat and set to work. First telegraphed to
happy Duke and Duchess of <span class="smcap">Teck</span> at White
Lodge. Then bethought him of happier father;
so Duke of <span class="smcap">York</span> hears from <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> who
"trusts Her Royal Highness and son are doing
well." <span class="smcap">Szlumper's</span> appetite growing with
what it feeds upon, he next approaches <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> with "loyal and sincere congratulations."
Finally, the Prince and Princess of
<span class="smcap">Wales</span> at Marlborough House hear from him.
<span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> always signs his name <i>tout court</i>,
like a peer of the realm.</p>

<p>"He's splendid this <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>," said the
Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>. "Reminds me of a story I
heard in America about Judge <span class="smcap">Hoar</span>. He had
great dislike to <span class="smcap">Wendell Phillips</span>. When
the great orator died they gave him a splendid
funeral. A friend meeting the judge on morning
of event said, 'Aren't you going to the
funeral?' 'No,' said <span class="smcap">Hoar</span>, 'but I approve it.'"</p>

<p>It wasn't <span class="smcap">Szlumper's</span> accouchement. But
he approves it.</p>

<p>Still on Budget; getting near end of first
part, which deals with death duties. The
Busy B.'s, seeing the close of opportunity at
hand, dash about with redoubled vigour.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="i2">And <span class="smcap">Byrne</span> and <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> and <span class="smcap">Bowles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clause XVIII. added to Budget Bill.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> sails to-day in the track of <span class="smcap">Columbus</span>,
only going much farther. He will cross Continent and Pacific to
pay a morning call on the <span class="smcap">Mikado</span>; afterwards to India and Burma.</p>

<p>"I want," he says, with certain proud pathos, "to see the frontier
I extended, and Burma which I annexed."</p>

<p>You remember the old French song written about <span class="smcap">Grandolph's</span>
great ancestor? It was sung as a lullaby to the little son of <span class="smcap">Louis
the Sixteenth</span>, and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> never mounted his horse for the
fight without humming the air,&mdash;</p>

<p class="i4">Ne sais quand reviendra!</p>
<p class="i4">Ne sais quand reviendra!</p>
<p class="i4">Ne sais quand reviendra!</p>
</div>

<p>There is a sad last verse to the old ballad. But we all hope to see
our <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> back again, bringing his sheaves with him in the
shape of renewed health and strength. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Don't Keir Hardie</span> confided to House to-night the
interesting fact that in particular he Don't Keir for the Royal
Family, and is "indisposed to associate himself" with effort to do
them special honour. Like old <i>Eccles</i> in <i>Caste</i>, he upbraids the
baby in the cradle with being a young aristocrat. Yet there are
limits even to his uncompromising Republicanism. The question
before House is the presentation to <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> of address of congratulation
on birth of son of Duke and Duchess of <span class="smcap">York</span>. "If I
had the opportunity of meeting the parents," says <span class="smcap">Don't Keir</span>, "I
should be pleased to join in the ordinary congratulations of the
occasion." He did not hesitate, standing in his place in Parliament
as representative of the electors of 'Am, to add that he "had been
delighted to learn that the child was a fairly healthy one." Beyond
that, stern principle would not permit him to pass.</p>

<p>Note that he felt constrained to modify even this approval of proceedings
at White Lodge by introduction of the word "fairly."
<span class="smcap">Asquith</span>, who knows all about it, seemed for moment inclined to
resent this aspersion on the perfect soundness of the object of his
recent attentions; on reflection he let it pass. <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span>, of
whom House has seen lamentably little of late, was under less complete
self-restraint. When <span class="smcap">Don't Keir</span> turned his attention upon
Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, proposing to appraise his value to the nation,
<span class="smcap">Saunderson</span> leaped to his feet, and moved that "the hon. Member
be no longer heard."</p>

<p>A difficult moment this. The Motion being made, the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
must put it from the Chair. Many Members, whilst justly angered
with <span class="smcap">Don't Keir's</span> grotesque performance, would have felt bound to
resent what might be construed as attempt to throttle free speech.
There would have been long and angry debate; a succession of
scenes; and <span class="smcap">Don't Keir Hardie</span> would have been triumphantly
advertised. Happily, though, strictly considered, irregularly, the
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> interposed; expressed hope that Motion would
not be persevered in. <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span> perceiving his mistake acquiesced,
and <span class="smcap">Don't Keir Hardie</span> went on to final ignominious collapse. When
in crowded House question put that Address be presented, a solitary
cry of "No" answered the loud shout "Aye." House cleared for
division; but when opportunity of taking final step presented itself, it
turned out that <span class="smcap">Hardie</span> Didn't Keir to take it.</p>

<p>"Now if this were France in the days when the Empire was tottering
to its fall," said <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, "I should suspect the secret police to have
put up <span class="smcap">Don't Keir</span> to play their game in stirring up embers of popularity
of Imperial Family. In England to-day, of course, no necessity
for such man&oelig;uvre. But if by outside influence the popularity
the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> has worked out for himself could be increased,
<span class="smcap">Don't Keir Hardie's</span> the man to do it."</p>

the Banded Brothers for the Regeneration of Human Kind, by means of equal

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Queen</span> congratulated on birth of latest great-grandson.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Been much struck through week by appearance of stranger
in Speaker's Gallery. Every night about quarter of an hour after
questions over he has come in; gone out again a little after eight,
about time <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, when in chair, leaves for his chop. Comes back
punctually in half an hour; remains till fifteen or twenty minutes
before progress is reported, and Chairman of Committees makes way
for <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>. Something about him familiar, though never before
that I remember have I seen that stubbly red beard, or those green,
goggly spectacles. Quite fascinated me. To-night went up and sat
in gallery behind him.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past eight, amendment before Committee disposed
of, the stranger rose; heard him exclaim under his breath, "Order!
Order!" saw him clutch at imaginary robe, and stride forth with
stately tread. Truth burst upon me with a flash.</p>

<p><i>It was the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>!</i></p>

<p>"You're a dangerous person to have about the premises, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he
said as we made our way by circuitous route to Speaker's Court.
"Every day for last fortnight I have written out myself an order for
the Speaker's Gallery, have passed the doorkeepers unobserved, and
remained hour after hour unnoticed. Then your eagle eye falls upon
me and all is lost. Pray don't let the secret go any further. Fact is,
for weeks and weeks I've been shut out of my proper place by this
Budget Bill. Questions last half an hour or an hour. Then House
goes into Committee, and I'm shunted save for few moments after
midnight, when I adjourn the House. Couldn't stand it any longer.
Might as well be in Kamtchatka. So have had recourse to this innocent
device, and have thoroughly enjoyed my evenings."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Once through Committee on Budget Bill. Pick

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
